# ExcelAutomation

  This is a spread sheet automation tool that work with a structure called a Working_Directory, which can be created automatically with the Create Working Directory functions. Here you put the spreasheets in the corresponding directories with the correct naming conventions, and just press start. Documents can also be converted from PDF files to JPEG, and can all be "signed" with photoshop with the click of a button.
